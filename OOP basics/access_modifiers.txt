Access Modifiers:-

    - The data or member functions we declared in a class have some sort of behavior in order to Access
      them from out side of the class.
    - Initially, there are three types of access specifiers are discussed.
        -> Public 
            - Every data and method is accessible from outside of the class and in other classes as well.
        -> Private (default)
            - The data and member functions are only accessible with in the class itself.
        -> Protected
            - Protected data and methods are accessible in the class which inherits the properties of its 
              parent class.

Getter and Setter Functions:-
    -> Setter Functions:
        The functions used to set the values of Private data members and to access their value outside the 
        class.
    -> Getter Functions:
        Once the values are set using setter ftns, Getter functions used to get those values of Private data members outside the class.
