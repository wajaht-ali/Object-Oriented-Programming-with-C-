Abstraction:-
    The ability to hide all unnecessary details and showing only important data is called abstraction.
    The best way of implementing abstraction is "Abstract" classes and access modifiers.

    => Abstract classes:-
        -> Only used to provide a base class to derive child classes.
        -> Particularly use to define an interface for the derived classes.
    => "Static Keyword":-
        -> The variable with static keyword gets initialized and instanciated for only once in the whole life cycle of program.
