Polymorphism:-
    -> The ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used.
    -> There are two types of polymorphism:
        = Compile time polymorphism (STATIC)
            -> Constructor overloading is an example (two constructors with d/f parameters).
            -> Function overloading is an example (two functions with same name but d/f parameters).

        = Run time polymorphism (DYNAMIC)
            ->  Function Overriding
              - When a parent and child class have same name of function but different implementation.
            ->  Virtual Functions
              - Is a member function which you expect to be redfined in child class.
